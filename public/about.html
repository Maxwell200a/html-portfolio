<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Maxwell</p>
<p>I hope you don't mind if i share my story with you? I grew up in a small neighbourhood in a little town in Awka City, Anambra state, Nigeria. 
  I attended Nadora Memorial Nursery and Primary School, Awka. And after my Primary Education i went to Unizik High school to begin my Secondary school Education.
  I did two years in Unizik (JSS1 and JSS2). After which i transfered to Bishop Uzodike Memorial Seminary Nnewi (BUMSEM). Where i repeated JSS2 and i also did my Confirmation the same year.</p>
  <p>I schooled at BUMSEM from JSS2 to SS2. Just a year left for me to complete my Secondary Education, i left BUMSEM for Command Secondary School Mbiri, Delta State. I left my Position as the 
  assistant Chapel Prefect and a co-hostel Captain of JSS1 Students.
  I am currently a Student of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka.
  My goal is to equip myself with tech and Math skills. And also use them to solve real world problems and possibly save lives.

<p>I once thought that building a start-up is a very easy task. Little did i know that it requires a lot of discipline and patience. Sometimes a lot of Capital/resources are required too.
   Some people built theirs from nothing. Armed with only the knowledge they acquired from the internet or a mentor and perhaps an institution that specialize on the skills he/she had an interest in. 
   I am currently learning how to code and also how to trade the foreing Exchange Market. I hope that from now till about 5-6months time that my skills will mature. 
   If i don't see significant progress by then i will still give myself time. After all i am still young.
   <strong>Thanks for your time. </strong></p>
